# Continual Learning/ Domain Adaptation

The directory named Experiment 1 assume which split is the test sample coming from. It has scripts for training and evaluating two as well as 3 splits of the following continual learning regularizers -

1. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)

2. Learning Without Forgetting (LWF)

3. Continual Replay Adaptation (CRA)

The directory named Experiment 2 does away with the earlier assumption and can classify directly given a test sample. The naming of the scripts are self-explanatory.
